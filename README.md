Machine Learning application for predicting the price of stocks based on past performance. This application was done using several packages to create the UI (TKinter), display and manipulate graphs (Sklearn) and add machine learning capabilities (Keras). The algorithm used was Long Short-term Memory, an adaptation of recurrent neural networks.
